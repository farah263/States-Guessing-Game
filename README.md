# States-Guessing-Game
This project is an interactive game where users guess the names of US states. Correct guesses are displayed on a map at their respective coordinates using Python's Turtle module, with state data handled via pandas from a CSV file.
# Features 
- Interactive US map with state outlines.
- Prompts users to guess state names.
- Correct guesses are marked on the map using CSV coordinates.
- The game ends when the user types "Exit" or guesses all 50 states.
- Guessed and missed states are exported to separate CSV files upon exiting.
# Usage 
1. Download all files into the same directory and run `main.py`.
2. Guess US state names based on on-screen prompts.
3. After exiting, two CSV files are created:
   - `Guessed_states.csv`: Contains correctly guessed states.
   - `Missed_states.csv`: Contains states not guessed.
